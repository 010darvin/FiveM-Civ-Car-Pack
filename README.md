# FiveM Civilian Car Pack

### How To Install
- Clone or direct download this repository to your server or wherever you may be hosting your FiveM server
  - If needed use an FTP (ex. Filezilla) to send this repo to your server
- Go to your `server.cfg` in your server files and copy everything you find in this [file](server.cfg.txt)
- You're done!
  - If you add this while your server is running, go to your live console and type, `refresh` then type `start *whatever*` to test any car out.
    - Once you add it into the server and do a restart, this extra step is unnecessary
