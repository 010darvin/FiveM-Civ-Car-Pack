***Want any car in here? Just make an issue with a download link and I'll get to it!***

### How To Install The Cars
- Clone or direct download this repository to your server or wherever you may be hosting your FiveM server
  - If needed use an FTP (ex. Filezilla) to send this repo to your server
- Go to your `server.cfg` in your server files and copy everything you find in this [file](server.cfg.txt)
- You're done installing the cars!
  - If you add this while your server is running, go to your live console and type, `refresh` then type `start *whatever*` to test any car out.
    - Once you add it into the server and do a restart, this extra step is unnecessary

### How to Install The Menu
- You will most likely already have this downloaded if you followed above
- Before you can use the menu you must install [NativeUI](https://github.com/FrazzIe/NativeUILua)
- in the `server.cfg` you must start NativeUI before this menu so like this:
```
start NativeUI 
start ploks_carmenu
```
